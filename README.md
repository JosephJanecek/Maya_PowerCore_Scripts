# Maya_PowerCore_Scripts
This Project is based off of a tutorial for python scripting in Maya.  The first video in the tutorial can be found at this link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXFGeZZbMzQ

I wanted to learn how to script in Maya and continue to develop my skills in Computer Graphics.  I found this tutorial and the project seemed cool so I decided to follow it all the way through.  You can see the finised product on my portfolio (https://www.josephjanecek.com/) with a more detailed description.
